# Projects Trading

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the course "Microstructures and Trading Systems." This repository contains our collaborative projects, which explore the financial market operations and the sophisticated systems used for trading. Microstructures focus on the mechanisms, regulations, and dynamics that underlie market transactions, while trading systems encompass the strategies and technologies employed to execute trades efficiently. These projects are a testament to the comprehensive knowledge and practical skills we have acquired throughout the course.
